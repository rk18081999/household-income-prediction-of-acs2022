# Predicting Household Income Using Machine Learning  
**Exploring Socioeconomic and Housing Dynamics with ACS 2022 PUMS Data**

## Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict household income levels using socioeconomic, housing, and employment-related variables. The dataset originates from the **American Community Survey (ACS) 2022 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)** and includes 819,000+ records from 26 U.S. states.

### Research Question  
**Can we predict a household's income category based on demographic, housing, and employment characteristics?**

## Objectives
- Analyze relationships between household income and factors like housing unit type, property value, and employment.
- Build ML models to predict income categories.
- Evaluate model performance and deploy a robust predictive solution.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: ACS 2022 PUMS Data  
- **Size**: 819,228 records | 241 features  
- **Filtered**: Focus on 26 states with >50,000 records each  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - *Demographic*: Age, Sex, Race, Marital Status  
  - *Economic*: Household Income (HINCP), Employment, Personal Income  
  - *Housing*: Property Value (VALP), Monthly Rent (GRNTP), Tenure (TEN), Unit Type

## Data Preprocessing
- **Imputation**: Median-based for numeric columns (e.g., NPF, OCPIP)  
- **Outlier Removal**: IQR-based filtering for HINCP and other skewed metrics  
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Income category bins (Very Low → Very High)
  - New variables: `Family_Type`, `TEN`  
- **Encoding & Standardization**: One-hot encoding + numerical scaling

## Feature Selection
- **LDA**: Used for dimensionality reduction & category separation visualization  
- **Random Forest**: Top predictors ranked (e.g., OCPIP, SMOCP, VALP)

## Models Trained
| Model            | Accuracy | Notes |
|------------------|----------|-------|

## Preferred Model: XGBoost
- Highest accuracy (93.21%)
- Faster and more interpretable than NN
- Scalable and easy to deploy

## Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**, Git, GitHub LFS (for large data)
